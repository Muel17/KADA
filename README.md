* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For core application logic and interactivity.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring the application and creating a visually appealing design.
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** (Optional: You can add any frameworks like React, Vue, or Node.js if you used them).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
    ```bash
    # Check if Node.js and npm are installed
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
* A modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Muel17/KADA.git](https://github.com/Muel17/KADA.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd KADA
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:**
    (This command assumes you have a `tsconfig.json` file set up to compile to a `dist` or `build` folder).
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    tsc
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application.

1.  **Start a local development server.** A simple way is to use a tool like `live-server` or a basic Python server.
    * **Using `live-server` (if installed):**
        ```bash
        live-server
        ```
    * **Using Python's built-in server:**
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```

2.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by your server). You should now see the KADA Cinema Ticketing System in action!
